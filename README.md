## Getting Started

To get this website template, simply change the information in the `me` folder in this repository. 🗂️

 - I have used an serverless aws component to send emails from the contact form. You can find the code in the `api` folder. 📧
`NEXT_SECRET_EMAIL_SERVICE_URL` is the environment variable that you need to set in your vercel project. 🚀

 - I have used Upstash Redis to store the view count of the website. You can find the code in the `api` folder. 📊
`NEXT_SECRET_UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` & `NEXT_SECRET_UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN` are the environment variables that you need to set in your vercel project. 🚀


## Technologies Used

 - Frontend: Next.js & Tailwind CSS
 - Backend: AWS Lambda [Email Service] & Upstash Redis [View Count]
